#### Personality and Emotions
I'm a calm person who thinks things through twice before making a decision. I don't usually show my emotions and/or feelings much; I'm very reserved.

#### Mentors or Inspiring People
I don't have a particular mentor, but I follow a developer influencer and front-end expert named midudev on Twitch, where I learn about the latest technology-related news.

#### Phrases that Inspire Me
I generally use the phrase "all forward, not even back to look back," which is a common phrase in Mexico.

#### Special Places and Destinations to Visit
Last year we went to Disneyland, and I think we enjoyed it the most. My wife and I, as well as my children, this year we plan to go to Xcaret, just my wife and I, on vacation.
